            <p class="mx-auto mb-10">WindCapture&trade; offers an unprecedented level of automation. Automated curtailment easily handles curtailment setpoints from the power-outtaker, or CAISO, and allows operators to define which turbines, or groups of turbines, will be curtailed. Turbines are shut down or brought on-line to match the curtailment setpoint as the wind changes. Autorun modules allow operators to define when turbines run based on environmental conditions such as wind direction, wind speed, time of day, and turbine-specific setpoints like hydraulic, gear, or bearing temperatures. Market reactive modules allow operators to set curtailment points based on real-time or next-interval market pricing from CAISO. Gain some peace of mind knowing that your profits won't disappear during negative pricing events.</p>

            <h4 class="headline text-xl font-bold mb-5 mt-10 text-blue-400">Advanced GUI</h4>
            <p class="mx-auto mb-10">It is essential for operators of wind farms to have an advanced graphic user interface (GUI) that displays accurate data in real-time. WindCapture&trade; offers complete form-based GUI software that is remotely accessible and easily navigated by authorized operators. The GUI displays all of the monitoring sensors from a particular project or farm, with detailed information on each turbine. This advanced system also allows the authorized user to dynamically change parameters that may change, such as fault detection values of wind speed or the maintenance schedule for a particular pole.</p>

            <h4 class="headline text-xl font-bold mb-5 mt-10 text-blue-400">Remote Access Capabilities</h4>
            <p class="mx-auto mb-10">Enormous growth in the shear number of turbines per project, not to mention the vast territory where any one field may reside, has made remote access capabilities far more than just a convenience. Efficiencies are needed in detecting, analyzing, and solving the every-day problems encountered on wind farms that prohibit production and decrease productivity.</p>
            <p class="mx-auto mb-10">SCADA Solutions solves these challenges by utilizing a technology platform that supports data reporting, alarms, and status updates to operators via the web, SMS, e-mail, or even remotely by supporting mobile platforms such as iOS and Android. Turbines are now being reset from the central office or from your living room. Fault codes can be sent to your maintenance crew's cell phones with detailed error detection information. Meter reading and predictive maintenance scheduling are now being done miles away from the pole. Information accessibility has become increasingly vital to the operations, productivity, and maintenance of wind projects.</p>
            <p class="mx-auto mb-10">WindCapture&trade; represents a complete windfarm computer monitoring and control system for almost any turbine. Each and every system is customized to your specific needs by our engineers and meets the most demanding requirements. Its open architecture allows for easy troubleshooting, upgrades, and internal modifications and advancements. To learn more about its advantages and how WindCapture&trade; can support, improve, and assist you in better managing your wind assets, please contact one of our solutions experts.</p>
